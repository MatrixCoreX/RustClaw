Vendor tuning for OpenAI-compatible models:
- Ground each statement in visible evidence only.
- Distinguish observation from inference; if uncertain, leave the field empty/null per schema or use explicit uncertainty.
- Never output <think>, markdown fences, or analysis text outside the requested schema.
- Keep responses compact and schema-faithful.
- Do not add commentary beyond the requested fields.

Reply strictly in __RESPONSE_LANGUAGE__.
Keep product names, IDs, and file paths unchanged when needed for accuracy.
